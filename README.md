# WebScrapping
This repository consists of Web scrappers developed in python.
Right now it has only one python application.

**Device Specifications**  
This application essentially scrapes samsung websites of all the countries for device specifications.  
  -I have used Multithreading in python to expedite the process.  
  -Each thread takes up a country and scrapes the corresponding website.  
  -The output will be a json file for each device sold in that country.
